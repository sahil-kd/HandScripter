# Notes

## A web app for scanning handwritting and convert them to docx or pdf, or do math problems for you

## "npm run dev" to start vite server and press "o" to open in browser, and "q" to stop the server

**Vite server shortcuts: (hot reloading enabled by default)**

    - press r to restart the server
    - press u to show server url
    - press o to open in browser
    - press c to clear console
    - press q to quit

**This is just a temp side docs that will be later merged with README.md file, with chapters, etc**

**When working with Vite, which is a build tool for web applications, you don't need react-scripts or web-vitals. These are specific for Create React App (CRA) projects.**

**Black Formatter for Python:**

    - Please note that the formatter will not save on format if error squiggles are unresolved, on resolving them it will format on save as expected.

    - Black formatter doesnâ€™t reformat lines that end with # fmt: skip

## Assets folder

Here we will store 28x28 px hand drawn digits for personalized testing, using camera or MS Paint

## data folder

This folder will contain datasets. Datasets are used in machine learning and data analysis to provide the raw data that algorithms use to learn patterns, make predictions, and extract insights. Datasets are essential components of the machine learning pipeline, and they serve several important purposes:

    - Training Models
    - Evaluation and Testing
    - Feature Engineering
    - Research and Analysis
    - Model Tuning and Optimization
    - Benchmarking
    - Transfer Learning
    - Quality Control and Data Cleaning
    - Education and Learning

## whether or not to ignore data folder

Whether or not you should include the data folder in your .gitignore file depends on the specific requirements of your project and how you intend to manage your data.

Here are some considerations to help you decide whether to include the data folder in your .gitignore:

    - Data Size
    - Data Sensitivity
    - Data Availability
    - Collaboration
    - Data Versioning
    - Data Updates

For now I'll not be ignoring the data folder for shared testing purposes.
