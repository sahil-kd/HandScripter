Install/update python, then install the following python libs:
    pip install opencv-contrib-python    # computer vision lib used for image editing (contrib installs all contributions)
    pip install tensorflow               # used for working with deep-learning networks
    pip install numpy                    # used for working with matrices
    pip install matplotlib               # this is used to visualize digits and points like MATLAB (optional)

    and also install the Black Formatter extension for python formatting on save (equivalent of prettier for js)

    To run this file, cd to Handwritting_recognizer then run: python src/main.py

# First we will load the dataset directly from tf module instead of downloading csv files and pre-processing them

mnist = tf.keras.datasets.mnist

# Now during training we have labelled data meaning we know what digit each picture corresponds to
# We split the labelled data into two parts: 1) Training data (80% of labelled data), 2) Testing data (20%)
# But in this case we use the load data function from mnist dataset which is already 80:20 splitted
# x-data refers to the actual image as a flattened matric of pixels (it's just the pixel data)
# y-data refers to the labelled digit i.e. what digit the image actually is

# this function returns two tuples (destructuring) | Black formatter doesnâ€™t reformat lines that end with # fmt: skip
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()  # fmt:skip

# Now we will normalize it meaning scale it down between 0 and 1, e.g. grayscale intensity value is between 0 to 255
# On normalizing it we get between 0 and 1
# Keep in mind we only wanna normalize the pixel values and not the labelling digits to make it easier for neural network
# to do the calculations

# Now the pre-processing part is over, now we will build the model and train it

# Now we add each layer to our model using model.add(layerType) function
# A flatten layer takes a p x q matrix and flattens it out into a list/array of p x q elements | Input layer

# here the mnist dataset is in 28x28 pixels so we use 28x28 matrix

# Softmax Activation Function definition in README.md file
